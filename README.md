# [Vue js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
For two future student project I will need to learn vue js. So at the same time, I will take the time to document everthing I learned, as good as possible.

# Basic Directives [Go to Vue directives](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Directives)
`v-text` = The same like bindig with double curly brackets `<h1>{{message}}</h1>` or `<h1 v-text='message'></h1>`

`v-html` = With v-html it is possbible to add some HTML-Tag with the message it self.

`v-show`= ItÂ´s pretty much the same like `v-if`, the only difference is that the code is loaded to the HTML but not displayed

`v-if` = If `false`the code is not displayed in the HTML-Code at all.

`v-else` = When `v-if='false'` then v-else.

`v-pre` = Will not render the message `<h1 v-pre>{{message}}</h1>` output in HTML will be `{{message}}`

`v-cloak` = This directive will remain on the element until the associated Vue instance finishes compilation. Combined with CSS rules such as `[v-cloak] { display: none }`, this directive can be used to hide un-compiled mustache bindings until the Vue instance is ready.

# v-bind
`v-bind` = This directive is used to bind attributes to the HTML-Tag. Like `v-bind:url=""` `v-bind:alt=""` `v-bind:title=""` an so on.

# v-for
`v-for` = This directive is used to loop through an array or a JSON-Object. It is pretty much the same like a foreach-loop. Here is an example syntax: `<li v-for="todo in todos">{{todo.text}}</li>` and in this case the JSON-Onject that is retunred from the data object ist called todos and has a field called text. For every todo in todos it will append a list item with the name of the todo.


# 2-way binding
`v-model` = `<h1>{{ message }}</h1>` `<input type="text" v-model="message"/>` What ever you type in this input it will be bind to the `<h1>`
